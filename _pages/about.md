# üëã About Me
Yi Jie Wong (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. degree (Hons.) in biomedical engineering from the Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Sungai Long, Malaysia, in 2022, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in digital technology with specialization of reinforcement learning and federated learning. His research interests include deep learning/deep reinforcement learning in the field of computer vision, federated learning, Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless communications. As a graduate research assistant, he participated in two international projects (ASEAN IVO and British Council), and a local industry grant. He also conducted a 3-month research stay at Universit√© Sorbonne Paris Nord, supported by the 2023 Doctoral Research Mobility Grant from the Embassy of France to Malaysia. He was also awarded best paper presentation in IEEE UEMCON 2021 Session 13, New York, USA. He was also one of the Top 10 Global Semi-Finalists of the 2024 EY Open Science Data Challenge, and the Champion of IEEE Big Data Cup 2024 Building Extraction Generalization Challenge.

# üîçResearch Topics

I am excited about the practical application of AI techniques and models to solve real-world problems. Hence, most of my work is in Applied AI, where I focus on solving problems rather than developing fancy models. Based on my experience in competitions and research consultancy projects, feature engineering and data understanding are crucial for building a solid baseline before moving on to more advanced models. 

- **Generative AI**: Diffusion Models, Diffusion Augmentation, etc.
- **Computer Vision**: Object Detection/Instance Segmentation, etc.
- **3D Computer Vision**: Point Cloud Detection, etc.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: System Optimization, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, etc.
